# Creating Microsoft Graph custom connector in Power Apps.

## What are Power Apps?
* Power Apps is a **suite of apps, services, connectors, and a data platform**, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for business needs. 
* Using Power Apps, one can quickly **build custom business apps that connect to data stored** either **in the underlying data platform** (Microsoft Dataverse) or in various **online and on-premises data sources** (such as SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server). 
* One can **create three types of apps** using this service: canvas, model-driven, and portal. 

## What are Microsoft Graphs?
* Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It **provides a unified programmability model** that you can use to access the tremendous amount of data in Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.
* The Microsoft Graph API **offers a single endpoint** to provide access to rich, people-centric data and insights in the Microsoft cloud.
* Microsoft Graph connectors work in the incoming direction, delivering data external to the Microsoft cloud into Microsoft Graph services and applications to enhance Microsoft 365 experiences such as Microsoft Search.
* Microsoft Graph Data Connect provides a set of **tools to streamline secure and scalable delivery of Microsoft Graph data** to popular Azure data stores. The cached data serves as data sources for Azure development tools that you can use to build intelligent applications.

## What are the uses of Microsoft Graph?
One can use Microsoft Graph to:
* Look at the next meeting and prepare for it by providing profile information for attendees, as well as information about the latest documents they're working on, and people they're collaborating with.
* Scans oneâ€™s calendar, and suggests the best times for the next team meeting.
* Fetch the latest sales projection chart from an Excel file in your OneDrive and update the forecast in real time, all from a phone.
* Subscribe to changes in the calendar, send an alert when one spending too much time in meetings, and provide recommendations for the ones one can miss or delegate based on how relevant the attendees are to you.
* Help one sort out personal and work information on a phone. For example, by categorizing pictures that should go to your personal OneDrive and business receipts that should go to your OneDrive for Business.
* Analyze at-scale Microsoft 365 data so that decision makers can unlock valuable insights into time allocation and collaboration patterns that improve business productivity.
* Bring custom business data into Microsoft Graph, indexing it to make it searchable along with data from Microsoft 365 services.

## What are custom connectors?
Connectors help make it easier for app and flow makers to connect to other apps, data, and devices in the cloud in the following ways:
* Connection is done in a consistent, repeatable way that is discoverable by makers.
* Connectors have actions that allow makers to control when an operation is performed.
* Connectors can have triggers that allow automation to start when the triggering event occurs.

## Prerequisites
None except the willingness to learn. This tutorial will be a beginner friendly step by step process. Are you ready? Let's go!

## Procedure
## * Create a custom connector
1. Check the connector reference to determine if a suitable connector already exists for the API/service.

2. Manually edit the connector definition in the maker portal or by importing a definition in a supported format. This process includes identifying the authentication requirements for the API.

3. Custom connectors can be used in the same way as built-in connectors. These connectors can also be used in an environment other than the one that you used to create it. The connector definition needs to be exported from the environment where it was created and then imported into any environment that needs it. 

4. Custom connectors are only available in environments where their definition exists and are not available to other Microsoft customers. By sharing a custom connector definition as an open source, you make it available on GitHub for other customers to import into their environments. 

## * Configure custom connectors with authenticated APIs in Power Automate

* Azure API Management Gateway
Custom connectors are supported by Microsoft Azure API Management infrastructure. When a connection to the underlying API is created, the API Management gateway stores the API credentials or tokens, depending on the type of authentication used, on a per-connection basis in a token store. This solution enables authentication at the connection level. 

* Azure API Authentication
Before using any connector in Azure Logic Apps, Power Automate, or Power Apps, the user needs to create a connection by authenticating to the network service. 
1. No authentication- No further information is required. 
2. Basic authentication- The user will provide the user name and password to create the connection. 
3. API Key- Used by web services. Make sure that you define- Parameter label, Parameter name, Parameter location
4. OAuth 2.0 authentication- Available for online connectors. Provides implementations for specific services and prebuilt identity provider templates, when selected, fill in many of the fields that are required by OAuth 2.0.
5. Windows authentication- Available only for connections that use on-premises data gateway, when the Connect via on-premises data gateway check box is set on the General tab. When a new connection is created, the user will need to provide Windows credentials for the service and then select one of the installed on-premises gateways.

* Azure AD Authentication
1. Select the Authentication/Authorization blade.
2. Enable the App Service Authentication.
3. Set the default action on unauthorized access.
4. Configure and register the app in Azure Active Directory.

Follow these steps to set up and configure connectors with Azure AD:
Register two Azure AD apps:
1. One to identify and protect API service
2. One to identify and protect your connector
3. Delegate permissions. Allow your connector's registered app to make "on-behalf" calls to your service's identity.
4. Define your connector by providing the client ID, secret, and resource URL information.
5. Add redirect URLs to the connector app registration.
If your service is set up with the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) scheme, allow list Azure API Management domains (usually azure-apim.net) for CORS on your service.
